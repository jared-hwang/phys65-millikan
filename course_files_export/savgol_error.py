        The slice parameters.

    Notes
    -----
    The keyword arguments start, stop and step are used by calling
    slice(start, stop, step).  This implies axis_slice() does not
    handle its arguments the exactly the same as indexing.  To select
    a single index k, for example, use
        axis_slice(a, start=k, stop=k+1)
    In this case, the length of the axis 'axis' in the result will
    be 1; the trivial dimension is not removed. (Use numpy.squeeze()
    to remove trivial axes.)

    This is a 1-d filter.  If `x`  has dimension greater than 1, `axis`
    determines the axis along which the filter is applied.
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The data to be filtered.  If `x` is not a single or double precision
        floating point array, it will be converted to type ``numpy.float64``
        before filtering.
    window_length : int
        The length of the filter window (i.e. the number of coefficients).
        `window_length` must be a positive odd integer. If `mode` is 'interp',
        `window_length` must be less than or equal to the size of `x`.
    polyorder : int
        The order of the polynomial used to fit the samples.
        `polyorder` must be less than `window_length`.
    deriv : int, optional
        The order of the derivative to compute.  This must be a
        nonnegative integer.  The default is 0, which means to filter
        the data without differentiating.
    delta : float, optional
        The spacing of the samples to which the filter will be applied.
        This is only used if deriv > 0.  Default is 1.0.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis of the array `x` along which the filter is to be applied.
        Default is -1.
    mode : str, optional
        Must be 'mirror', 'constant', 'nearest', 'wrap' or 'interp'.  This
        determines the type of extension to use for the padded signal to
        which the filter is applied.  When `mode` is 'constant', the padding
        value is given by `cval`.  See the Notes for more details on 'mirror',
        'constant', 'wrap', and 'nearest'.
        When the 'interp' mode is selected (the default), no extension
        is used.  Instead, a degree `polyorder` polynomial is fit to the
        last `window_length` values of the edges, and this polynomial is
        used to evaluate the last `window_length // 2` output values.
    cval : scalar, optional
        Value to fill past the edges of the input if `mode` is 'constant'.
        Default is 0.0.
    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray, same shape as `x`
        The filtered data.

    savgol_coeffs
    Notes
    -----
    Details on the `mode` options:
        'mirror':
            Repeats the values at the edges in reverse order.  The value
            closest to the edge is not included.
        'nearest':
            The extension contains the nearest input value.
        'constant':
            The extension contains the value given by the `cval` argument.
        'wrap':
            The extension contains the values from the other end of the array.
    For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], and
    `window_length` is 7, the following shows the extended data for
    the various `mode` options (assuming `cval` is 0)::
        mode       |   Ext   |         Input          |   Ext
        -----------+---------+------------------------+---------
        'mirror'   | 4  3  2 | 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 | 7  6  5
        'nearest'  | 1  1  1 | 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 | 8  8  8
        'constant' | 0  0  0 | 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 | 0  0  0
        'wrap'     | 6  7  8 | 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 | 1  2  3
